## About This Tool

### Why Lead Scoring?

Lead scoring prioritizes sales leads to focus efforts on prospects with the highest potential, improving sales efficiency and conversion rates.

### Business Logic Used

* Revenue normalized against max revenue to assess financial size.
* Growth percentage to capture momentum.
* Employee count to focus on small-to-mid sized companies (50-150 employees favored).
* Company age to prefer newer, potentially more innovative companies (founded ‚â• 2015).
* Keyword presence (like "SaaS") to boost relevance in software-as-a-service domain.

### Why Mock Enrichment?

Real email enrichment APIs can be costly and require access permissions. Mock enrichment simulates email generation for demo and development purposes, showcasing integration without external dependencies.

### Real-World Use Case Alignment

This tool can assist sales and marketing teams in lead qualification, data cleansing, and contact discovery, helping businesses improve pipeline quality with minimal manual effort.
